# (AI Generated) Security Related Acceptance Criteria
**API Gateway**
- **AC1:** The API Gateway must authenticate and authorize the Meal Planner application using the provided `client-uuid` before allowing access to the `/api/v1/storeContent` endpoint.
- **AC2:** The API Gateway should validate and sanitize the input parameters (`type`, `dietitian-uuid`, `client-uuid`, `content`) to prevent injection attacks or malformed requests.
- **AC3:** The API Gateway should enforce rate limiting to protect against excessive requests or potential denial-of-service attacks.
- **AC4:** The communication between the Meal Planner application and the API Gateway must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.

**API Application**
- **AC5:** The API Application must validate and authenticate the `dietitian-uuid` to ensure the dietitian is registered in the AI Nutrition-Pro system before processing the request.
- **AC6:** The API Application should implement proper error handling and return appropriate error responses when the `dietitian-uuid` is not found or the request is invalid.
- **AC7:** The API Application must validate and sanitize the `content` parameter to prevent the storage of malicious or invalid data.
- **AC8:** The API Application should implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or insecure deserialization.

**API Database**
- **AC9:** The API Database must enforce access controls to ensure that only authorized entities (i.e., the API Application) can write data to the SAMPLES table.
- **AC10:** The communication between the API Application and the API Database must be encrypted using TLS to protect the data in transit.
- **AC11:** The API Database should store the `content` as a serialized JSON string to prevent any potential injection attacks.
- **AC12:** The API Database should be configured to enforce data integrity constraints and validate the data before storing it in the SAMPLES table.
