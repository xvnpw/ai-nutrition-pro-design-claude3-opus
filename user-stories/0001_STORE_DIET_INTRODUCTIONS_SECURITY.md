# (AI Generated) Security Related Acceptance Criteria
**API Gateway**
- **AC1:** The API Gateway must implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Meal Planner application, such as using secure API keys with sufficient complexity and length.
- **AC2:** The API Gateway must implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive requests and protect against denial-of-service attacks.
- **AC3:** The API Gateway must validate and sanitize all input data received to prevent injection attacks.

**API Application**
- **AC4:** The API Application must implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as using secure authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) and applying the principle of least privilege.
- **AC5:** The API Application must implement proper error handling to ensure that sensitive information is not disclosed in error messages.
- **AC6:** The API Application must implement secure coding practices and undergo regular security code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**API Database**
- **AC7:** The API Database must implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms, such as using secure database authentication (e.g., IAM database authentication) and applying the principle of least privilege.
- **AC8:** The API Database must enable encryption at rest to protect sensitive data.
- **AC9:** The communication between the API Application and the API Database must be encrypted using TLS.
