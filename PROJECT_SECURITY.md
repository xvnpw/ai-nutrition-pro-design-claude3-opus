# (AI Generated) High Level Security and Privacy Requirements

### 1. Data Encryption
- **Requirement**: Implement strong encryption mechanisms for all sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health data.
- **Description**: Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) to encrypt data at rest and in transit. Ensure that encryption keys are securely managed and rotated regularly.

### 2. Access Control
- **Requirement**: Implement granular access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access sensitive data.
- **Description**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to define and enforce access policies based on user roles and responsibilities. Implement least privilege principles to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

### 3. Secure API Communication
- **Requirement**: Ensure that all communication between AI Nutrition-Pro and client applications (e.g., DietMaster Pro, Nutritionist Pro) is secure and encrypted.
- **Description**: Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) to encrypt data in transit. Implement mutual authentication to verify the identity of both the client application and AI Nutrition-Pro.

### 4. Data Segregation
- **Requirement**: Ensure that data is properly segregated and isolated between tenants, dietitians, and customers.
- **Description**: Implement logical and physical data segregation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage between different tenants, dietitians, and customers.

### 5. Secure Data Storage
- **Requirement**: Ensure that all sensitive data is securely stored and protected in the AWS cloud environment.
- **Description**: Use AWS services such as Amazon S3 or Amazon RDS with encryption enabled to securely store sensitive data. Implement proper access controls and monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts.

### 6. Logging and Monitoring
- **Requirement**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents and anomalies.
- **Description**: Enable logging for all critical activities, including authentication attempts, data access, and API calls. Use AWS services such as Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to centralize logs and monitor for suspicious activities.

### 7. Secure Integration with ChatGPT
- **Requirement**: Ensure that the integration between AI Nutrition-Pro and ChatGPT 3.5 is secure and follows best practices.
- **Description**: Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms when integrating with ChatGPT 3.5. Ensure that sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed or shared with the LLM provider.

### 8. Data Retention and Deletion
- **Requirement**: Implement data retention and deletion policies to ensure that sensitive data is not retained longer than necessary.
- **Description**: Define clear data retention policies and implement mechanisms to securely delete data when it is no longer needed. Ensure that data deletion requests from tenants, dietitians, or customers are promptly processed.

### 9. Compliance with Privacy Regulations
- **Requirement**: Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the data processed.
- **Description**: Conduct a thorough analysis of applicable privacy regulations and implement necessary controls and processes to ensure compliance. This may include obtaining user consent, providing privacy notices, and facilitating data subject rights.

### 10. Security Testing and Auditing
- **Requirement**: Conduct regular security testing and auditing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system.
- **Description**: Perform periodic vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and security audits to identify and remediate security risks. Engage with third-party security experts to validate the security posture of AI Nutrition-Pro.
